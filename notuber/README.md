* notuber homework

* The map part of the homework has
* been implemented. The navigator, 
* the httpRequests also have been 
* implemented. The function to 
* calculated the distance from me
* has been implemented too. 
* Every marker has also an info window
* that calculates the distances from 
* me.
* However, I was not able to implement
* the info window pointing at me that 
* shows the shortest distance from me.
* The Major reason for this is that 
* I was able to return an array 
* containing the shortest distance
* but could not access it with 
* javascript methods.
