		<h1>Introduction: </h1>
		<p>
			Notuber is a simple web application that uses express and a Mongodb for storage.
			I was hired to find security flaws present in the application. 			
		</p>		
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>Methodology: </h1>
		<p>
			Use of Curl to send data to the application.
			Use of username[$ne]=something in a Query.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>Abstract of Findings: </h1>
		<p>
			Vulnerable to XSS.
			MongoDB Injection
			No latest MongoDb
			App has internal server error
			
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>Issues Found: </h1>
		<p>
			UNSANITAZED INPUT: Due to unsanitazed input this application can accept Javascript and this is a 
			vulnerability that can lead an attacker taking advantage of the application.
			SEVERITY: MEDIUM
			REASON: This vulnerability can lead to a db being highjacked or worse depending on the kind of script that the attacker uses.

			MONGODB INJECTION: MongoDB injections can work on this application resulting in the 
			server sending back to the attacker nearly all the information 
			stored in the db. The injection returns an associative array of all 
			elements that are in the db.
			SEVERITY: HIGH
			REASON: This vulnerability, if present in production, can lead to 
			a leak of information of millions stored in the db.
			
			NO LATEST MONGODB: This program does not use the latest mongodb. The old ones are vulnerable to Denial of Service 
			attack. 
			SEVERITY: HIGH
			
			INTERNAL SERVER ERROR: The program shows an internal server error when not run locally. So basically the app can only run
			locally.

		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h1>Conclusion: </h1>
		<p>
			The programmer should use the latest version of the libraries and frameworks to allow fixes that took place to be into the app.
			However using the latest version of the application comes with the cost of needing to change the code base for compatibility.
